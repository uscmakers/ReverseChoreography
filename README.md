# ReverseChoreography
Repository for Reverse Choreograph (Fall 2021-Spring 2022)

data: Folder containing raw motion data

preprocessed: Folder containing files generated by preprocess.ipynb. For each file in the data folder, 3 files (x, y, and z data) are created here containing position and displacement data for each used body point.

parser_output: Folder containing a single .csv file where each row corresponds to one data run and the columns contain features extracted from that data run. Generated by parser-update.ipynb

recommendation pipeline:

model.sav is the best regression model obtained by running preprocess.ipynb, parser.ipynb, then regression_model_testing.ipynb

recommend.py accepts a csv file containing motion information and recommends 5 songs using model.sav
